Baking Info
=====

Baking data is required to store calculated data to avoid heavy calculations each time. This should be done after each :ref:`road change <roadEdit>` and before the launch of the scene.

**Baked data:**
	* :ref:`Road segment data <roadSegmentBakingInfo>`.
	* :ref:`Path data <pathBakingInfo>`.

How To Bake
-------------------

#. Open :ref:`RoadParent <roadParentInfo>` in the main scene or :ref:`subscene <subscene>` (:ref:`recommended <roadEdit>` in the main scene for performance reasons).
