Traffic Public Route
=====

Defined public route for :ref:`public transport <trafficPublic>`.

How To Create
------------

#. Create necessary :ref:`road segments <roadSegmentCreator>`.
#. Connect the created segments by :ref:`paths <path>`.
#. Create an empty `GameObject` and add the :ref:`TrafficPublicRoute <trafficPublicRouteComponent>` component.
#. Enable the :ref:`Show path selection buttons <trafficPublicRouteSceneSettings>` option.
#. Sequentially select each :ref:`path <path>` of the route (also you make a :ref:`lane change <trafficPublicRouteHowToCreateTransition>`).

	`Selection route example.`
	
#. Customize :ref:`Route settings <trafficPublicRouteSettings>`.
#. Make sure you have created at least one compatible (matching :ref:`TrafficPublicType <trafficPublicType>` and :ref:`Car model <carModel>`) :ref:`TrafficPublic <trafficPublic>` vehicle.

Transition Info
------------

Transition paths are used for transition between lanes of public transport.
