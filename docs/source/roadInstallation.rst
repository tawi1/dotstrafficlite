Entity Subscene Creation
----------------
	
From `DOTS 1.0 <https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.0/manual/index.html>`_ onwards, all entity conversions must be done using subscenes. It's necessary to create a separate :ref:`subscene <subscene>` for roads.

	.. image:: /images/road/installation/Hub.png
	
Steps:
	#. Select :ref:`Hub <hub>` in the scene.
	#. Select `Entity subscene path` the path to create a :ref:`subscene <subscene>`.
	#. Enter the `Entity subscene name` or use the default name.
	#. On/off autosync configs (before migrating the configs to the :ref:`subscene <subscene>`, they will be synchronized with the configs that are in the :ref:`Hub <hub>`).
	#. On/off copy physics shapes feature (read more about :ref:`physics shape transferring <physicsShapeTransfer>`) **[optional]**.
	#. Press the `Generate` button.
	#. All created :ref:`RoadSegments <roadSegment>` will automatically be moved to the :ref:`subscene <subscene>`.
