Traffic Node
=====

`Traffic node is a set of traffic node entities that are connected to other traffic node entities by a :ref:`path <path>`

| **Traffic light crossroad** : the :ref:`crossroad <trafficLightCrossroad>` to which the node belongs.
| **Traffic light handler** : traffic light that the traffic node is linked (:ref:`TrafficLightHandler <trafficLightHandler>`).

Lane Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **Lanes** : :ref:`right side lanes <trafficNodeRightDirection>` (to connect `TrafficNodes` within a :ref:`RoadSegment <roadSegment>`).
| **External lanes** : :ref:`left side lanes <trafficNodeLeftDirection>` (to connect nodes in :ref:`external RoadSegments <trafficNodeConnectionExample>`) (:ref:`additonal info <trafficNodeLeftDirectionInfo>`).

| **Lane count** : number of lanes.
| **Lane width** : lane width.
| **Chance to spawn** : chance of the vehicle spawning in the node.
| **Weight** : weight of the node for route selection by traffic.
| **Custom achieve distance** : custom distance to achieve a node (if 0 value default value will be taken).
| **Capacity** : capacity of the nodes (used for parking, bus station, etc...).

**Light type:** 
	* **Right** : right-hand lanes have traffic lights.
	* **Left** : left-hand lanes have traffic lights.
	* **Right and left** : right and left lanes have traffic lights.
	
**Traffic node type:** 
	* **Default**
	* **Parking** : node where cars are :ref:`parked <trafficArea>` (read more :ref:`parking states <trafficParking>`).
	* **Traffic public stop** : node where :ref:`public traffic <trafficPublic>` stops to pick up passengers. 
	* **Destroy vehicle** : node where the vehicle entity is destroyed (useful for nodes outside the map).
	* **Traffic area** : :ref:`TrafficArea node <trafficArea>`.
	* **Idle** : node where the vehicle is idling.
	
| **Is one way** : all lanes are one-way traffic lanes (:ref:`more info <trafficNodeOneWay>`).
| **Is end of one way** : node ends one-way traffic for this :ref:`RoadSegment <roadSegment>` (:ref:`more info <trafficNodeOneWay>`).
| **Lock path auto creation** : on/off prevent auto path creation (:ref:`more info <autoPathConnection>`).
| **Auto path is created** : auto path is created (:ref:`more info <autoPathConnection>`).
	
Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **Connect** : node will try to :ref:`connect <autoPathConnection>` to other nodes if no external paths are created yet.
| **Force connect** : node will try to :ref:`connect <autoPathConnection>` to other nodes whether it is :ref:`connected <autoPathConnection>` now or not (except `Lock path auto creation` option is enabled).
| **Resize** : resize :ref:`collider <trafficNodeCollider>` of node.

Direction Connection Info
----------------

.. _trafficNodeRightDirection:

Rightside Lanes
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Rightside lanes (default lanes) connect :ref:`TrafficNodes <trafficNode>` within a :ref:`RoadSegment <roadSegment>`.

	.. image:: /images/road/trafficNode/ConnectionInfoExampleRightSide.png
	`Rightside lanes example.`

.. _trafficNodeLeftDirection:

Leftside Lanes
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Leftside lanes (external lanes) connect :ref:`TrafficNodes <trafficNode>` in external :ref:`RoadSegments <roadSegment>` (:ref:`external connection example <trafficNodeConnectionExample>`).

	.. image:: /images/road/trafficNode/ConnectionInfoExampleLeftSide.png
	`Leftside lanes example.`
	
.. _trafficNodeLeftDirectionInfo:

	.. warning:: Intersecting `External paths` should be replaced by a separate :ref:`segment <roadSegment>` to :ref:`bake the intersection of the paths <roadSegmentBakingInfo>`.
	
.. _trafficNodeRotation:

Node Rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
	
Direction of each :ref:`TrafficNode <trafficNode>` must be opposite to the center of the segment

	.. image:: /images/road/trafficNode/TrafficNodeDirectionExample.png

**Example description:**
	* The arrow represents the forward rotation of the :ref:`node <trafficNode>`.
	* Purple arrows the direction of the outer :ref:`nodes <trafficNode>` of the :ref:`segment <roadSegment>`.
	* Blue arrows the direction of the internal :ref:`segment <roadSegment>` :ref:`oneway nodes <trafficNodeOneWay>`.

.. _autoPathConnection:

Auto-path Connection
----------------

* To quickly create connections between :ref:`RoadSegments <roadSegment>` on the same line, the `Auto-Path` connection is used. 
* If the :ref:`segments <roadSegment>` are not on the same line you should to create another :ref:`Custom straight road segment <roadSegmentCreatorCustomStraight>` or :ref:`Custom segment <roadSegmentCreatorCustomSegment>` between them and do the same connection.
* You can also manually create paths between :ref:`segments <roadSegment>` using the :ref:`PathCreator tool <pathCreator>`.

How To Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

* To activate auto-connection paths for all nodes you can in :ref:`RoadParent <roadParentInfo>` by pressing `Connect` button. 
* Each time you create a new :ref:`RoadSegment <roadSegment>` or move an existing :ref:`RoadSegment <roadSegment>`, press `Reset` and press `Connect` in :ref:`RoadParent <roadParentInfo>`, then `Bake Path Data` (:ref:`baking info <pathBakingInfo>`).

.. _trafficNodeCollider:

	.. note:: 
		* To prevent auto-path connection for the selected :ref:`TrafficNode <trafficNode>` enable **Lock path auto creation** in the :ref:`settings <trafficNodeSettings>` of the node.
		* Each :ref:`TrafficNode <trafficNode>` has a `box collider` whose is size calculated based on the number of lanes, their width, and the type of lanes (:ref:`one-way <trafficNodeOneWay>` or not).
		* Make sure that the :ref:`direction of the node <trafficNodeRotation>` is set correctly.

CullState Info
----------------

:ref:`States <cullPointInfo>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Culled** : entity not available for spawning.
* **CloseToCamera** : entity available for spawn.
* **InVisionOfCamera** : entity available for spawn only during the initial scene start.
