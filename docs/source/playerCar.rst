Player Car

Common Info
----------------

* Each player car only works in :ref:`Hybrid custom physics <entityType>` type & consists of 2 parts: `DOTS` entity is handled by DOTS systems & `Monobehaviour` hybrid skin (required for camera tracking & npc car layout) that follows the binded :ref:`DOTS entity <playerHybridDots>`.
* Player hybrid skin car should have following components:

	* **Player Actor** : camera tracking component.
	* **PlayerNpcCarBehaviour** : logic of the NPC shooting from the car.
	* **CarSlots** : stores the NPC data that is in the car (Npcs sitting in the car are taken from the `PlayerNpcCarFactory`).

	.. note::
		Look at `PlayerCarSkinBase` prefab example.

.. _playerHybridDots:

Hybrid DOTS
----------------

* Player vehicle physics handled by `DOTS` systems.
* The hybrid skin follows the `DOTS` entity.

How To Create
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open :ref:`Car Prefab Creator <carPrefabCreator>` & set `Car type` to `Player` in the `Prefab` tab.
#. Set `Player simulation type` to `Hybrid DOTS` in the `Prefab` tab.
#. Make sure `Player simulation type` is set to :ref:`Hybrid DOTS <playerHybridDotsConfig>` in the player car settings (make sure that config on the :ref:`subscene <subscene>` has the same value).
#. Create a vehicle using the :ref:`Car Prefab Creator <carPrefabCreator>` tool.
#. Create prefab variant from the `PlayerCarSkinBase` prefab & assign to :ref:`Player Car Pool <playerCarPool>` according to the vehicle.
#. Customize the car slots in the created prefab if you plan to make the NPC's shooting option from the car **[optional step]**.
#. Once all the steps have been completed, reimport :ref:`subscene <subscene>`.

.. _playerHybridMono:

Hybrid Mono (experimental)
----------------

* Player vehicle physics handled by custom user's `Monobehaviour physics plugin`.
* Unlike the :ref:`Hybrid DOTS <playerHybridDots>`, the entity following & presents collider for `DOTS` world without mesh representation.
* The `DOTS entity` collider processes the collision with the `DOTS physics world` & adds impulses to the vehicle's `Rigidbody <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html>`_ according to the calculated impulse.

* List of vehicle controllers from the Asset Store that can be used for (e.g.) 
	* `Edy's Vehicle Physics <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/edy-s-vehicle-physics-403>`_
	* `Realistic Car Controller Pro <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/realistic-car-controller-pro-178967>`_
	* `NWH Vehicle Physics 2 <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/nwh-vehicle-physics-2-166252>`_
	* `Universal Vehicle Controller Plus <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/universal-vehicle-controller-plus-176314>`_
	* `MS Vehicle System <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/ms-vehicle-system-vehicle-controller-88035>`_
	* `Sim-Cade Vehicle Physics <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/sim-cade-vehicle-physics-243624>`_

	.. note::
		* To make the vehicle work, the :ref:`main scene <mainScene>` should have default Unity `colliders <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.html>`_ (read more about :ref:`PhysicsShape Transfer tool <physicsShapeTransfer>`).
		* Processing a combination of `DOTS physical world <https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.physics@1.2/manual/index.html>`_ and the `default physical world <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsSection.html>`_ at the same time may require additional CPU resources.

How To Create
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open the :ref:`Car Prefab Creator <carPrefabCreator>` & set `Car type` to `Player` in the `Prefab` tab.
#. Set `Player simulation type` to `Hybrid mono` in the `Prefab` tab.
#. Set the `Hybrid mono` in the :ref:`Player car settings <playerHybridMonoConfig>` config (make sure that config on the :ref:`subscene <subscene>` has the same value).
#. Drag & drop your desired prefabs into the `Prefabs` field.
#. Click the `Scan` button.
#. Customize :ref:`Save settings <carPrefabCreatorSaveSettings>` in the `Save` tab.
#. In the `Prefab Info` tab, enter the vehicle :ref:`ids <trafficId>` (:ref:`ids <trafficId>` should match the traffic cars :ref:`ids <trafficId>` if you want to make option enter & exit for the player npc).
#. Click the `Create` button.
#. Ensure that the bounds of the entities created match the prefabs you have selected.
#. Input for the player vehicle is implemented according to your vehicle controller plugin.
#. The input enable & disable for the car when the player's npc exits & enters the car should be implemented in the `PlayerInteractCarService.cs` in the `EnterCar` & `ExitCar` methods.
#. Once all the steps have been completed, reimport :ref:`subscene <subscene>`.
